When would you want to use a remote repository, rather than keeping all your work local?

This is probably so that other people can pull down your code, and you can pull down other people's code, and stay curent.
If you and a friend each just worked locally, there may be a lot of problems and a lot of merging to be done if you weren't sharing
the whole time.
